== COLLISION-MODULE ==

- collision.js
  + implement seperating axis theorem for optimizng collision between convex polygons.

- ColliderComponent
  + REQUIRES - transform, polygon, transform
  + get bounds (from polygon)
  + get subpolygons (cached from polygon)

- RigidbodyComponent
  + REQUIRES - collider component, polygon, transform
  + gravity
  + weight
  + friction

- PhysicsSystem against RigidbodyComponent, ColliderComponent
  + broad phase collision
    - seperate canvas into 4 parts - Map<string(entity id), string(area)>
    - sweep and prune using aabb
  + narrow phase collision
    - SAT subpolygon (or currently, we will use the polygonToPolygon from collision.js)
